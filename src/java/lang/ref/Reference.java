    /* A Reference instance is in one of four possible internal states:  引用实例的四种状态
     *
     *     Active:  激活态  Subject to special treatment by the garbage collector.  Some
     *     time after the collector detects that the reachability of the
     *     referent has changed to the appropriate state, it changes the
     *     instance's state to either Pending or Inactive, depending upon
     *     whether or not the instance was registered with a queue when it was
     *     created.  In the former case it also adds the instance to the
     *     pending-Reference list.  Newly-created instances are Active.
     *
     *     Pending:  等待中 An element of the pending-Reference list, waiting to be
     *     enqueued by the Reference-handler threadpool.  Unregistered instances
     *     are never in this state.
     *
     *     Enqueued: 入队 An element of the queue with which the instance was
     *     registered when it was created.  When an instance is removed from
     *     its ReferenceQueue, it is made Inactive.  Unregistered instances are
     *     never in this state.
     *
     *     Inactive: 非激活 Nothing more to do.  Once an instance becomes Inactive its
     *     state will never change again.
     *
     * The state is encoded in the queue and next fields as follows:
     *
     *     Active: queue = ReferenceQueue with which instance is registered, or
     *     ReferenceQueue.NULL if it was not registered with a queue; next =
     *     null.
     *
     *     Pending: queue = ReferenceQueue with which instance is registered;
     *     next = this
     *
     *     Enqueued: queue = ReferenceQueue.ENQUEUED; next = Following instance
     *     in queue, or this if at end of list.
     *
     *     Inactive: queue = ReferenceQueue.NULL; next = this.
     *
     * With this scheme the collector need only examine the next field in order
     * to determine whether a Reference instance requires special treatment: If
     * the next field is null then the instance is active; if it is non-null,
     * then the collector should treat the instance normally.
     *
     * To ensure that a concurrent collector can discover active Reference
     * objects without interfering with application threads that may apply 有了这些约束，收集器为了确定一个引用对象是否需要特别对待只需要检查next字段：
     * the enqueue() method to those objects, collectors should link如果next字段是null这个实例就是活跃的；如果不为null，这收集器就应该正常对待这个实例了。
     * discovered objects through the discovered field. The discovered
     * field is also used for linking Reference objects in the pending list.
