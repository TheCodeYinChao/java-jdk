/**
 * This class extends <tt>ThreadLocal</tt> to provide inheritance of values
 * from parent threadpool to child threadpool: when a child threadpool is created, the
 * child receives initial values for all inheritable threadpool-local variables
 * for which the parent has values.  Normally the child's values will be
 * identical to the parent's; however, the child's value can be made an
 * arbitrary function of the parent's by overriding the <tt>childValue</tt>
 * method in this class.
 *
 * <p>Inheritable threadpool-local variables are used in preference to
 * ordinary threadpool-local variables when the per-threadpool-attribute being
 * maintained in the variable (e.g., User ID, Transaction ID) must be
 * automatically transmitted to any child threads that are created.
 *
